## What Is a Single Fiber Media Converter?

A single fiber media converter is an active device that converts electrical signals to optical signals for transmission over a single fiber strand. At the receiving end, the optical signal is converted back into an electrical signal for use with network devices, video systems, or data equipment.

These converters are commonly purchased for installations where space or cabling restrictions require a single-fiber solution.

Typical purchasing considerations include:
- buy single fiber media converter for point-to-point network connections  
- purchase single fiber media converter online for commercial or industrial setups  
- order a single fiber media converter to extend Ethernet or video over long distances

## Why Use a Single Fiber Media Converter?

Traditional copper cabling limits distance and is susceptible to electromagnetic interference. Single fiber media converters eliminate these issues while reducing cabling requirements and enabling long-distance transmission over a single fiber strand.

A single fiber media converter is used to:
- transmit data or video signals over long distances using one fiber strand  
- reduce installation costs by minimizing cabling requirements  
- provide stable and interference-free signal transmission in commercial or industrial environments
